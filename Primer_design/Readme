This is python script to design primers to knockout a gene included in a fastA file from a genome in fastA file.
1) It blasts the gene against the genome, outputs the exact allele that the strain has.
2) extracts sequence of upstream and downstream of the gene. Sizes of these pieces are included as input.
3) designs primers to amplify those two fragments using primer3
4) adds the necessary over hangs for gibson cloning
5) designs confirmation primers that are designed to be outside of the cloning primers
6) outputs all of the designed primers with overhangs to primers.csv
7) for Klebsiella it outputs the fragment (upstream + apramycin cassette + downstream) of DNA these primers are meant to amplify and clone as complete.fasta
8) for Pseudomonas is outputs the fragment (upstream + scar + downstream) of DNA these primers are meant to amplify and clone as complete.fasta

This requires local installations of:
primer3-py (1.1.0) pip install primer3-py
biopython (1.23.1) pip install biopython
blast (2.13.0+) https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/


Usage:

python3 Primer_design.py {gene fastA file} {genome fastA file} {Species Kp or Pa} {plasmid 1 or 2 (only important for Pa)} {size of each fragment in b} {Maximum melting temp of primers}

Using the files in the sample data folder:

For Klebsiella (pUC16R6k)
python3 Primer_design.py genes.txt genome.fasta Kp 1 500 63

For Pseudomonas (pexG2)
python3 Primer_design.py genes.txt genome.fasta Pa 1 750 68

For Pseudomonas (pex18hyg)
python3 Primer_design.py genes.txt genome.fasta Pa 2 750 68

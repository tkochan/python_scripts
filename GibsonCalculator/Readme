This is a Gibson Calculator GUI that:
 Calculates the amount of volume of insert and vector to add based off of molar ratio, fragment size, and DNA concentrations.
  
 It autofills sizes for the fragments that are part of my normal workflow.
 
 It also has an export button that will export the values to an existing CSV to the next available line (it will not over write the file).
